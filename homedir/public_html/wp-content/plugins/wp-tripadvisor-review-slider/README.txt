Create a TripAdvisor review slider! Allows you to easily display your TripAdvisor business reviews in your Posts, Pages, and Widget areas!

== Description ==
Easily display your TripAdvisor reviews on your WordPress site! Check the video below to see how you can get TripAdvisor reviews showing in under 2 minutes!

Show TripAdvisor reviews on your site with a Shortcode or Widget! Let's face it, no one really trusts testimonials unless they can verify the source. When they see this TripAvisor testimonial slider they will know the reviews are coming from TripAdvisor. Each review has a TripAvisor icon right on the review.

This is a great way to increase SEO while building user confidence! You work hard for your 5 star TripAdvisor reviews, now you can easily display them on your WordPress site in a Post, Page, or Widget!

Here's a quick video demonstration of adding TripAdvisor reviews in less than 2 minutes!

If you have any sort of travel business you know how important TripAdvisor reviews can be. It's one of the top review sites people use when researching hotels, restaurants, things to do, tours and tickets, etc... If you have a good rating on TripAdvisor, it's a good idea to display your best reviews on your website. By proving to prospective customers that you have a good reputation from an independent site like TripAdvisor, you can increase social proof and build customer confidence which leads to more sales.

If you don't have any TripAdvisor reviews, don't worry it's pretty easy to get going. More than likely TripAdvisor already has your business on their site. All you have to do is claim it. If it isn't then you can easily submit it. After you have it listed, just reach out to your past customers and ask for a review on TripAdvisor.

Some of the Features:

* Created and supported by the developer based in the US.
* Sliders are awesome! Now you can easily create multiple sliders with your TripAdvisor reviews.
